#Sea-C26 Visualize a Data Structure's Algorithm
## When Brook created his deck of cards, I wanted to apply the same ideas to create html element that would represent abstract shapes or objects. I decided to create two arrays of ten classes that could be applied at random to div elements as they were being generated. 
## My first go created one div with random size and color, but each additional div retained the previous classes. Scott Schmitt helped me get my variables in the correct scope. 
## I was daunted by the code used to for the sorting algorthims online and needed something i could apply to jQuery selectors. I found what appears to be an insertion sort algorthims intended to alphabetize li elements after adding new ones. //http://www.onemoretake.com/2009/02/25/sorting-elements-with-jquery/  
## I posted my work this far on the Slack message board and Craig Chaille suggested sorting by '.width' and this allowed me to meet my goal of being able to sort by both classes.
